# Logs Analysis Project Submission

## Project Description
This project uses a Python3 file to run three queries on a database contained in newsdata.sql

The database contains three tables (author, articles, and log)

The three queries answer the following:
1. What are the three most popular articles in the database, based on page views?
2. What are the three most popular authors, based on total page views for all articles?
3. On which days did more than 1.0% of page view requests result in an error?

## Running the Code
Execute the logs_analysis.py file in a Terminal:

```
python3 logs_analysis.py
```
